"""Luba remote-control web server.

Browses to the page → drives the mower over WebSocket joystick + REST actions,
all routed through HC33ProxyTransport to the HC33 firmware over WiFi/HaLow.

Camera is optional and starts OFF.  Click "Start Camera" to:
  1. Lazily log into the Mammotion cloud (HTTP only — no MQTT, no device
     registration).
  2. Fetch a fresh Agora stream token.
  3. Send the explicit `device_agora_join_channel_with_position(1)` to the
     mower over BLE so it starts publishing.
  4. Return the token to the browser, which subscribes via Agora Web SDK.

Single-process, single-file.  Use uvicorn directly:

    uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

or just `python app.py` for the same with --reload disabled.

# password is set, so an un-onboarded install isn't accidentally locked out.
# Use over TLS only (run-server.bat serves https on 8443).
#
# Session = a signed cookie.  When it's missing/invalid, browser navigations are
# redirected to an HTML login form (/login) rather than the native HTTP Basic
# dialog — the form integrates with Chrome/iOS password managers (save +
# autofill), which the Basic dialog never did, especially on iOS where a
# self-signed cert stops the cookie persisting across restarts.  A `Basic`
# Authorization header is still accepted for scripted clients but never
# advertised (no 401 challenge), so it won't pop a browser dialog.
#
# WebSocket gotcha: browsers (notably Chrome) do NOT attach an `Authorization`
# header to a `wss://` upgrade, so gating the socket on Basic alone closes the
# joystick.  The cookie covers it: browsers DO send cookies on same-origin WS
# upgrades, and the page only loads when authenticated, so the cookie is present.
